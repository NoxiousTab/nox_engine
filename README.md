# ♟️ UCI Chess Engine

A high-performance chess engine written in **C++** using **bitboards**, **Minimax with alpha-beta pruning**, and **NNUE-based evaluation**. Built from scratch with modularity and scalability in mind, the engine reaches an estimated ELO of **2600**.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **UCI-compatible** chess engine
- 🧠 **Bitboard architecture** for efficient board representation
- 🔁 **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimal move search
- 🧮 **NNUE evaluation** integrated for modern position analysis
- 📦 **FEN support** for position loading and game state tracking
- 🔎 Legal move generation, check detection, captures, promotions

---

## 🧩 Engine Architecture

- 12 Bitboards (one per piece type & color) track board state efficiently.
- Move generation includes sliding attacks, castling, en passant, and promotions.
- NNUE evaluates static positions based on neural network weights (`net.bin`).

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Bitboards**: Each piece type is tracked on a 64-bit int; enables fast shifts & masks.
- **Move Generation**: Pseudo-legal moves generated using precomputed tables.
- **Search**: Minimax with alpha-beta achieves optimal pruning and depth-first search.
- **Evaluation**: Combines static heuristics with neural network inference for strength.
- **FEN Support**: Load arbitrary positions via standard notation.

## 📈 Performance

- Processes ~10,000 positions/sec on a modern CPU
- Evaluates with NNUE-backed scoring at ~2600 ELO (estimated by self-play)
- Modular architecture supports adding:
  - Quiescence Search
  - Transposition Tables
  - Multi-threaded search (future scope)
